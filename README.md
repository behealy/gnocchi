# gnocchi

A simple command-line password management utility written in go.

## Todos

- [] "Last updated" timestamp for each set of credentials so that users can tell how old their passwords are.
- [] Timeout that "logs out" of gnocchi if it is idle for too long.
- [] Visual hash for master password.
- [] Some sort of way to share account info files between clients without a server.
- [] Getting account password: What if we have multiple usernames or accounts for one site or service? 
- [] List only one entry, or fuzzy search for entries
- [] Use protocol buffers for binary format instead of my custom thing-a-majang.
